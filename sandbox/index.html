                        Writing poor quality code will dramatically reduce the time

                        enough to leave a project shortly after such a contribution
                        everyone who subsequently has to work with your code will
                        think you an arsehole.

                    <h2>Be descriptive and concise</h2>

                    <p>
                        It’s the most obvious naming rule of all but it’s also
                        perhaps the most difficult. In my younger years I would
                        often use very descriptive names, I pulled the following
                        doozy from the archives:
                    </p>

                    <pre class="example  example--bad">design_inspiration_competition_promotion_code_list</pre>

                    <p>
                        At a whopping 50 characters it can hardly be described as
                        nondescript, however I’m sure anyone who came after would
                        have cursed me for using such a long name. A far better name
                        for my list of promotion codes would have been:
                    </p>

                    <pre class="example  example--good">promotion_codes</pre>

                    <p>
                        Or possibly:
                    </p>

                    <pre class="example  example--good">promo_codes</pre>

                    <p>
                        However care should be taken when using abbreviations or
                        acronyms. Only use an abbreviated term if it is well known
                        and/or its use is standard practice (e.g db, id, url, etc.)
                        If you’re not sure if an abbreviated form of a term is well
                        known err on the side of caution and don’t abbreviate:
                    </p>

                    <pre class="example  example--bad">p_codes</pre>

                    <pre class="example  example--bad">pcs</pre>

                    <p>
                        There is one exception to this rule - list or dictionary
                        comprehensions (if you’re not familiar with list
                        comprehension look it up). Using a single letter
                        abbreviation in this case is preferential to a more
                        descriptive name, for example:
                    </p>

                    <pre class="example  example--bad">[employee.name for employee in employees \
             if employee.role == “developer”]</pre>

                    <pre class="example  example--good">[e.name for e in employees if e.role == “developers”]</pre>

                    <h2>Be conscious of scope</h2>

                    <p>
                        In the first rule we reduced a very descriptive term to a
                        more concise version promotion_codes. So why not reduce it
                        further (e.g codes) and why was it acceptable to reduce it
                        at all? The answer lies in scope.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The scope in which you declare a variable determines how
                        much information must be included in the name. For example a
                        variable declared in the settings module for a project will
                        infer little information from its scope and therefore needs
                        to be more descriptive.
                    </p>

                    <pre class="example  example--bad">settings.username = 'foo'</pre>

                    <pre class="example  example--good">settings.db_username = 'foo'</pre>

                    <p>
                        Now consider the scope when the same variable is used in a
                        function:
                    </p>

                    <pre class="example  example--bad">def connect_to_db(db_username, db_password):</pre>

                    <pre class="example  example--good">def connect_to_db(username, password):</pre>

                    <p>
                        The purpose of our function is to connect to the database
                        and therefore we can infer that the supplied username and
                        password are for this purpose and there’s no need to include
                        db in the variable names.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On occasion it may be necessary to use more descriptive
                        names to avoid a naming conflict within the same scope.
                        Consider our first example where we declared a username for
                        the database in the settings file, what if the project uses
                        multiple databases?
                    </p>

                    <pre class="example  example--good">settings.redis_db_username = ‘foo’
         ...

         settings.mysql_db_username = ‘bar’
         ...</pre>

                    <p>
                        Here the name of the database application is used to
                        namespace the variables and avoid any conflict whilst
                        keeping the names themselves as concise as possible.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Pluralize when naming collections</h2>

                    <p>
                        Harking back again to my youth there was a time where I
                        would have avoided using plurals at all costs, instead
                        opting to follow the convention of appending <i>_list</i> to
                        any variable associated with a collection of items. With the
                        benefit of time I’ve come to prefer variable names that
                        sound natural.
                    </p>

                    <pre class="example">for colour in colour_list:
        ...

    for colour in colours:
        ...</pre>

                    <p>
                        I’ve refrained from marking either example as good or bad as
                        they are both acceptable in my eyes, however colours would
                        be the preferred term purely on the base it is the most
                        concise and natural sounding.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Advocates for using <i>_list</i> often argue that it reduces
                        common spelling mistakes with words like category/categories
                        and hero/heroes. I would counter that in the same way I will
                        grammar and spell check this document before asking you to
                        read it you should take the same pride in the code you
                        write.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Read your code out loud</h2>

                    <p>
                        If you can read a line of code and comprehend it in one
                        that’s a good indication that it’s well written using good
                        variable names. If on the other hand if jars or you find
                        yourself re-reading it multiple times before it makes sense
                        then there’s room for improvement.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Reading your code out loud (or in your head if you’re
                        attracting too much attention) is a sure fire way to spot
                        badly named variables.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Above all else be consistent</h2>

                    <p>
                        When you work with old or externally written code chances
                        are there will be difference in the rules the author(s) used
                        when coming up with variable names. Unless you’re going to
                        rewrite and maintain all the code in future do not break
                        from the existing naming conventions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If they prefix numbers with num_ or append _list to lists
                        then follow suite, whilst conventional wisdom tells us two
                        wrongs don’t make a right, mixing styles within a project
                        will only make things worse.
