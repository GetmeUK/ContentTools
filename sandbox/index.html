                    Writing poor quality code will dramatically reduce the time
                    you get to spend doing things you love, if you’re lucky
                    enough to leave a project shortly after such a contribution
                    everyone who subsequently has to work with your code will
                    think you an arsehole.

                    <b>Above:</b> This example is code found in
                    a live and commercial project. Clearly the developer thought
                    <b>user.n5</b> would still clearly point to the 5th
                    character of a the user's name when used elsewhere.

                    The names we devise for folders, files, variables,
                    functions, classes and any other user definable construct
                    will (for the most part) determine how easily someone else
                    can read and understand what we have written.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To avoid repetition in the remainder of this section we use
                    the term variable to cover folders, files, variables,
                    functions, and classes.

                <h2>Be descriptive and concise</h2>

                <p>
                    It’s the most obvious naming rule of all but it’s also
                    perhaps the most difficult. In my younger years I would
                    often use very descriptive names, I pulled the following
                    doozy from the archives:
                </p>

                <pre class="example  example--bad">design_inspiration_competition_promotion_code_list</pre>

                <p>
                    At a whopping 50 characters it can hardly be described as
                    nondescript, however I’m sure anyone who came after would
                    have cursed me for using such a long name. A far better name
                    for my list of promotion codes would have been:
                </p>

                <pre class="example  example--good">promotion_codes</pre>

                <p>
                    Or possibly:
                </p>

                <pre class="example  example--good">promo_codes</pre>

                <p>
                    However care should be taken when using abbreviations or
                    acronyms. Only use an abbreviated term if it is well known
                    and/or its use is standard practice (e.g db, id, url, etc.)
                    If you’re not sure if an abbreviated form of a term is well
                    known err on the side of caution and don’t abbreviate:
                </p>

                <pre class="example  example--bad">p_codes</pre>

                <pre class="example  example--bad">pcs</pre>

                <p>
                    There is one exception to this rule - list or dictionary
                    comprehensions (if you’re not familiar with list
                    comprehension look it up). Using a single letter
                    abbreviation in this case is preferential to a more
                    descriptive name, for example:
                </p>

                <pre class="example  example--bad">[employee.name for employee in employees \
         if employee.role == “developer”]</pre>

                <pre class="example  example--good">[e.name for e in employees if e.role == “developers”]</pre>

                <h2>Be conscious of scope</h2>

                <p>
                    In the first rule we reduced a very descriptive term to a
                    more concise version promotion_codes. So why not reduce it
                    further (e.g codes) and why was it acceptable to reduce it
                    at all? The answer lies in scope.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The scope in which you declare a variable determines how
                    much information must be included in the name. For example a
                    variable declared in the settings module for a project will
                    infer little information from its scope and therefore needs
                    to be more descriptive.
                </p>

                <pre class="example  example--bad">settings.username = 'foo'</pre>

                <pre class="example  example--good">settings.db_username = 'foo'</pre>

                <p>
                    Now consider the scope when the same variable is used in a
                    function:
                </p>

                <pre class="example  example--bad">def connect_to_db(db_username, db_password):</pre>

                <pre class="example  example--good">def connect_to_db(username, password):</pre>

                <p>
                    The purpose of our function is to connect to the database
                    and therefore we can infer that the supplied username and
                    password are for this purpose and there’s no need to include
                    db in the variable names.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On occasion it may be necessary to use more descriptive
                    names to avoid a naming conflict within the same scope.
                    Consider our first example where we declared a username for
                    the database in the settings file, what if the project uses
                    multiple databases?
                </p>

                <pre class="example  example--good">settings.redis_db_username = ‘foo’
     ...

     settings.mysql_db_username = ‘bar’
     ...</pre>

                <p>
                    Here the name of the database application is used to
                    namespace the variables and avoid any conflict whilst
                    keeping the names themselves as concise as possible.
                </p>

                <h2>Pluralize when naming collections</h2>

                <p>
                    Harking back again to my youth there was a time where I
                    would have avoided using plurals at all costs, instead
                    opting to follow the convention of appending <i>_list</i> to
                    any variable associated with a collection of items. With the
                    benefit of time I’ve come to prefer variable names that
                    sound natural.
                </p>

                <pre class="example">for colour in colour_list:
    ...

for colour in colours:
    ...</pre>

                <p>
                    I’ve refrained from marking either example as good or bad as
                    they are both acceptable in my eyes, however colours would
                    be the preferred term purely on the base it is the most
                    concise and natural sounding.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Advocates for using <i>_list</i> often argue that it reduces
                    common spelling mistakes with words like category/categories
                    and hero/heroes. I would counter that in the same way I will
                    grammar and spell check this document before asking you to
                    read it you should take the same pride in the code you
                    write.
                </p>

                <h2>Read your code out loud</h2>

                <p>
                    If you can read a line of code and comprehend it in one
                    that’s a good indication that it’s well written using good
                    variable names. If on the other hand if jars or you find
                    yourself re-reading it multiple times before it makes sense
                    then there’s room for improvement.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Reading your code out loud (or in your head if you’re
                    attracting too much attention) is a sure fire way to spot
                    badly named variables.
                </p>

                <h2>Above all else be consistent</h2>

                <p>
                    When you work with old or externally written code chances
                    are there will be difference in the rules the author(s) used
                    when coming up with variable names. Unless you’re going to
                    rewrite and maintain all the code in future do not break
                    from the existing naming conventions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If they prefix numbers with num_ or append _list to lists
                    then follow suite, whilst conventional wisdom tells us two
                    wrongs don’t make a right, mixing styles within a project
                    will only make things worse.
                </p>
